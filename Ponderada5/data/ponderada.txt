Workshop safety is everyone's responsibility and the following rules have been put in place to ensure the safety of all students and staff.  Please read the safety rules carefully before entering the workshop.Safety glasses must be worn at all times when in the workshop.When students are operating machinery, all other students are to stay clear and not to talk to the operator. If you feel uneasy or unsafe operating any tools or machinery in the workshop, inform the workshop supervisor and help will be provided.Machinery that students are not allowed to operate includes:Tools to be used only under strict supervision include router and trimmer. All other tools may be used by students as long as they have been inducted into the workshop and been tested in their capability to use them.Check that any tools you have been using have been put away in the appropriate spots, clean up your work area and notify the workshop staff.Fooling around and practical jokes in the workshop will not be tolerated – students will be told to leave.All accidents, cuts and abrasions must be reported before leaving the workshop. If an accident does happen, no matter how small, it must be reported to the workshop staff and an accident report form completed. Filling out this form is imperative for any future complications resulting from an accident.Think before reacting to any emergency in the workshop to ensure you are reacting safely, before you assist in an emergency. Do not attempt to fight any fire unless you have been trained to do so.For more information contact the supervisors, Greg Shield or Anthony Swanborough.
